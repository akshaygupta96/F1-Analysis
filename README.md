# F1-Analysis
This repository is to analyse the F1 race with the F1 sprint results. 
F1 Sprint is a shorter race (1/3 of the entire race distance) held on the Saturday before the main Sunday Grand Pri. It was introduced in 2021 with 2 main goals.
1. To create more excitement for viewers during the grand prix weekend.
2. To encourage more opportunities for drivers to fight and gain points, especially for those from mid-tier teams. 

The main objective of this analysis is to see to what extent has the sprint achieved the second goal.
